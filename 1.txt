¡°Grandma, where have you been all these years? You will not leave me from now on, will you?¡± It was the second time that Nancy had talked in her dream like this that week. It seemed that something about her grandmother kept haunting in her mind all the time. Actually, her grandmother had passed away for nearly twelve years and she was not a little girl any longer.
 Unlike those lucky children, Nancy did not know the name of her own parents, not to mention the possibility of receiving love from her parents. She was abandoned by her parents the first day she was born. When Nancy was very young, she was told by some villagers that she was found by her grandmother under a tree by chance. As an old lady whose age was about sixty years old, her grandmother did not live with her son in the city. Instead, she chose to live in the small village alone and do farmwork. After she found Nancy, she took the poor girl home and treated Nancy as her own child.
